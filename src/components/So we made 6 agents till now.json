So we made 6 agents till now.
We somewhat started from a flowchart diagram that I have uploaded.

Now we want to tie up this 6 agents with proper branching that if this happened what should be done and if not what should.
We have to arrange all the 6 agents in that way according to project diagram that I have uploaded.
Guide me with that properly with every small details.
Try to be specific and perfect.
Its quite crucial for us.
I am listing you outputs of all 6 agents.
